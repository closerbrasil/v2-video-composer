- Choose from different instruction templates (podcast, lecture, summary, etc.)
- Customize text generation and audio models
- Select different voices for speakers

## How to Use

1. Upload one or more PDF files
2. Select the desired instruction template
3. Customize the instructions if needed
4. Click "Generate Audio" to create your audio content

## Use in Colab
